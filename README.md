# divergent-thinking-the-blog
Hi, I'm AJ and I'm a divergent thinker. According to current medical understanding, my ADHD, anxiety, and bipolar make my approach to life differs from the norm...often significantly.

I spend most of my life fighting against the problems created by being different. Why? Because data suggests people subconsciously dislike people they consider "different." A quick way to confirm this bias is to look at just a few words used to describe the concept. Weird. Weirdo. Abnormal. Divergent. Strange. Odd. Oddball. These words and even "different" to most of us have some degree of negative connotation attached to them.

This area will be different. This blog will allow me to unleash my divergence. Join me to participate in the off-the-wall adventures undoubtably ahead.

# Schedule
Unlike my accountability blog, this blog is intended to be fun. Thus, I may post feverishly multiple times a day and then take months off. Again, I'm different. I hope you stick around and become part of a community committed to abnormal creativity in ideas, thinking, and doing. I'll do my best to post at least once a quarter...but let's remain flexible and see what happens.
